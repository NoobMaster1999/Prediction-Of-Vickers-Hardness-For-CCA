## Machine learning model for complex concentrated alloys/high entropy alloys using TensorFlow

Author: Soumen Basak

This is a work-in-progress of a machine learning model to attempt to predict the Vickers hardness of CCAs.

The image below shows the comparison between the values indicated in the articles and the values predicted by the model. 
The data was divided between training set and test set.

This model considers the composition of the alloy, some descriptive parameters (such as VEC, atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) and its condition. There are five conditions currently used:
 - AC: As-cast
 - HM: Homogenized
 - WR: Work hardening
 - PM: Powder metallurgy
 - AM: Additive manufacturing
